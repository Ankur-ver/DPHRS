# DPHRS
This is a Decentralized Personal Health Record System (DPHRS) built on Ethereum Blockchain .It aims to give patients more control, privacy, and security over their medical data by decentralizing the storage and access.

## Project Overview
The **Decentralized Personal Health Record (PHR) System** on blockchain is designed to empower patients with full ownership and control over their medical data. By leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology, this system decentralizes data storage and access, providing patients with a secure, private, and interoperable solution for managing their health records.

## Key Features
1. **Data Ownership and Control**  
   Patients have full ownership of their health data and can decide who has access, allowing for greater autonomy and privacy compared to traditional health record systems.

2. **Enhanced Security and Privacy**  
   Blockchainâ€™s cryptographic mechanisms ensure that health records are tamper-resistant and accessible only by authorized parties, protecting data from unauthorized access and breaches.
   
4. **Transparency and Auditability**  
   Every access to the PHR is logged on the blockchain, creating an immutable and transparent audit trail. Patients and providers can review this history, enhancing accountability and trust.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Provides a secure and decentralized infrastructure for storing health record access logs and metadata.
- **Smart Contracts**: Handle access permissions, data sharing agreements, and interactions between users and healthcare providers.
- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: Decentralized file storage for securely storing large health data files, referenced by blockchain pointers.
- **Frontend Framework**: A user-friendly interface for patients and providers to access and manage health records.
- **Backend**: Facilitates interactions between the blockchain, smart contracts, and the frontend application.
